## Simulation

Final paragraph before Discussion ... surely it must be not "just as much" but "more than"? In other words, it must be more likely for new items than old to be called old. This still seems pretty odd to me. I'm not particularly worried because it's a tiny effect and it probably comes from something uninteresting like the particular rectilinear way we placed and removed stimuli from the space. So I guess I'm saying just think carefully about what and how much you say here because it's not obvious (at least to me) how an idealized version of this experiment ends up with <0 d' with SUSTAIN.
