# Working on the Manuscript after the Reviewers comments

- Make clear why are you doing it (also that you are not discrediting COVIS)
- Make it more about SUSTAIN and less about COVIS.

What is the message?

The message is that SUSTAIN can capture the ordinal response patterns
we observe in these data. We are not interested in quantitative
fits to data, but in the model's general ability to accommodate the
performance differences between the two different category structures.

What is the goal?

The goal is to show that there are formal computational models out there
that can do the base results and poses architectures that can extend
to auxiliary findings. Our aim is to diversify the research on these
paradigms and not to exclude models that can populate the hypothesis
space.

Four main themes in reviews:

1. COVIS vs SUSTAIN
2. RECOGNITION
3. Neural links between SUSTAIN and HPC.
4. Quantitative fits vs ordinal fits
5. Interested in whether SUSTAIN accomodates this ordinal pattern and not in quantitaive fit

SUSTAIN is sufficient, but not the only account.
