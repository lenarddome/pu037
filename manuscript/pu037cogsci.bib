  abstract = {The long history of categorization experiments indicates that many important design choices can critically affect the quality of the resulting data. Unfortunately, the optimal choices depend on the goals of the experiment, so there is no single template that a new researcher can follow. This chapter describes methods needed to design effective categorization experiments, and spe-cialized methods for analyzing the resulting data. First, a number of important experimental design choices are discussed, including: 1) whether a categorization or identification experi-ment is more appropriate, 2) what type of category structure should be used, 3) how to choose the stimuli, 4) how to construct the categories so they have optimal statistical properties, 5) how to present feedback following each response, and 5) design choices that make it easy to assess participant performance. Second, several specialized methods for analyzing categorization data are described, including forward and backward learning curves, and a statistical procedure for strategy analysis that can identify participants who were guessing, using a single-cue explicit rule, or using some multi-cue similarity-based strategy.},

First, a general perceptual theory is used to formally characterize large classes of existing decision models according to the type of decision boundary they predict in a multidimensional perceptual space. A new experimental paradigm is developed that makes it possible to accurately estimate a subject's decision boundary in a categorization task. Three experiments using this paradigm are reported. Three conclusions stand out: (a) Subjects adopted deterministic decision rules, that is, for a given location in the perceptual space, most subjects always gave the same response; (b) subjects used decision rules that were nearly optimal; and (c) the only constraint on the type of decision bound that subjects used was the amount of cognitive capacity it required to implement. Subjects were not constrained to make independent decisions on each component or to attend to the distance to each prototype.},

Two separate formal descriptions of the theory are also provided. One describes trial-by-trial learning, and the other describes global dynamics.

When the boundary separating the contrasting categories was unidimensional, the accuracy of all observers improved significantly over blocks (i.e., learning occurred), and all observers eventually responded optimally. When the optimal boundary was diagonal, none of the observers responded optimally. Instead they all used some sort of suboptimal unidimensional rule. In a separate feedback experiment, all observers responded optimally in the diagonal condition. These results contrast with those for supervised category learning; they support the hypothesis that in the absence of feedback, people are constrained to use unidimensional rules.},

With rule-based structures, the effects of training type were small, but with information-integration structures, accuracy was substantially higher with feedback training, and people were less likely to use suboptimal rule-based strategies.

With the rule-based category structures, neither change in response instructions interfered with categorization accuracy. However, with the information-integration structures, switching response key assignments interfered with categorization performance, but switching hands did not. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that abstract category labels are learned in rule-based categorization, whereas response positions are learned in information-integration categorization. The association to response positions also supports the hypothesis of a procedural-learning-based component to information integration categorization.},

Four different kinds of category-learning tasks are currently popular-rule-based tasks, information-integration tasks, prototype distortion tasks, and the weather prediction task. The cognitive, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging results obtained using these four tasks are qualitatively different. Success in rule-based (explicit reasoning) tasks depends on frontal-striatal circuits and requires working memory and executive attention. Success in information-integration tasks requires a form of procedural learning and is sensitive to the nature and timing of feedback. Prototype distortion tasks induce perceptual (visual cortical) learning. A variety of different strategies can lead to success in the weather prediction task. Collectively, results from these four tasks provide strong evidence that human category learning is mediated by multiple, qualitatively distinct systems.},

  abstract = {A number of studies have shown that in category learning, providing feedback about errors allows faster learning than providing feedback about correct responses. However, these previous studies used explicit, rulebased tasks in which the category structures could be separated by a simple rule that was easily verbalized. Here, the results of the first experiment known to compare the efficacy of positive versus negative feedback during information-integration category learning are reported. Information-integration tasks require participants to integrate perceptual information from incommensurable dimensions, and evidence suggests that optimal responding recruits procedural learning. The results show that although nearly all of the full-feedback control participants demonstrated information-integration learning, participants receiving either positive-only or negative-only feedback generally used explicit, rule-based strategies. It thus appears that, unlike rule-based learning, consistent information-integration learning requires full feedback. The theoretical implications of these findings for current models of information-integration learning are discussed.},

This principle derives from focused sampling in the internal feedback model (D. Billman \& E. Heit, 1988) of unsupervised, or observational, learning. In 3 experiments, the authors tested how the organization of structure in input (value systematicity) affected unsupervised learning of categories about alien animals. Across all experiments, learning a target rule was easier in conditions with high value systematicity, relative to several low systematicity controls. The authors compare results to predictions of several learning models and consider the links between learning and the resulting category structure.},

Three experiments investigated analogical transfer in rule-based and information-integration categorization tasks. In rule-based tasks, the optimal strategy is easy to describe verbally, whereas in information-integration tasks, accuracy is maximized only if information from two or more stimulus dimensions is integrated in a way that is difficult or impossible to describe verbally. In all three experiments, analogical transfer was nearly perfect in the rule-based conditions, but no evidence for analogical transfer was found in the information-integration conditions.

  abstract = {Huge amounts of money are spent every year on unlearning programs\textendash in drug-treatment facilities, prisons, psychotherapy clinics, and schools. Yet almost all of these programs fail, since recidivism rates are high in each of these fields. Progress on this problem requires a better understanding of the mechanisms that make unlearning so difficult. Much cognitive neuroscience evidence suggests that an important component of these mechanisms also dictates success on categorization tasks that recruit procedural learning and depend on synaptic plasticity within the striatum. A biologically detailed computational model of this striatal-dependent learning is described (based on Ashby \& Crossley, 2011). The model assumes that a key component of striatal-dependent learning is provided by interneurons in the striatum called the tonically active neurons (TANs), which act as a gate for the learning and expression of striatal-dependent behaviors. In their tonically active state, the TANs prevent the expression of any striatal-dependent behavior. However, they learn to pause in rewarding environments and thereby permit the learning and expression of striatal-dependent behaviors. The model predicts that when rewards are no longer contingent on behavior, the TANs cease to pause, which protects striatal learning from decay and prevents unlearning. In addition, the model predicts that when rewards are partially contingent on behavior, the TANs remain partially paused, leaving the striatum available for unlearning. The results from 3 human behavioral studies support the model predictions and suggest a novel unlearning protocol that shows promising initial signs of success.},

The part-based pathway establishes mappings between sensory input and symbols that encode discrete stimulus features, whereas the image-based pathway applies holistic templates to sensory input. Our experiments used rule-plus-exception structures, in which one exception item in each category violates a salient regularity and must be distinguished from other items. In Experiment 1, we found discrete representations to be crucial for recognition of exceptions following brief training. Experiments 2 and 3 involved multisession training regimens designed to encourage either part- or image-based encoding. We found that both pathways are able to support exception encoding, but have unique characteristics. We speculate that one advantage of the part-based pathway is the ability to generalize across domains, whereas the image-based pathway provides faster and more effortless recognition.},

  abstract = {Category learning is a complex phenomenon that engages multiple cognitive processes, many of which occur simultaneously and unfold dynamically over time. For example, as people encounter objects in the world, they simultaneously engage processes to determine their fit with current knowledge structures, gather new information about the objects, and adjust their representations to support behavior in future encounters. Many techniques that are available to understand the neural basis of category learning assume that the multiple processes that subserve it can be neatly separated between different trials of an experiment. Model-based functional magnetic resonance imaging offers a promising tool to separate multiple, simultaneously occurring processes and bring the analysis of neuroimaging data more in line with category learning's dynamic and multifaceted nature. We use model-based imaging to explore the neural basis of recognition and entropy signals in the medial temporal lobe and striatum that are engaged while participants learn to categorize novel stimuli. Consistent with theories suggesting a role for the anterior hippocampus and ventral striatum in motivated learning in response to uncertainty, we find that activation in both regions correlates with a model-based measure of entropy. Simultaneously, separate subregions of the hippocampus and striatum exhibit activation correlated with a model-based recognition strength measure. Our results suggest that model-based analyses are exceptionally useful for extracting information about cognitive processes from neuroimaging data. Models provide a basis for identifying the multiple neural processes that contribute to behavior, and neuroimaging data can provide a powerful test bed for constraining and testing model predictions.},

Our experimental paradigm includes the presentation of nonreinforced transfer stimuli that improve one's ability to discriminate among the predictions of alternative models. Our model-selection techniques incorporate uncertainty in the identification of individuals as either rule-based or information-integration strategy users. Based on this analysis we identify 48\% of participants as unequivocally using an information-integration strategy. However, adopting the standard practice of using a restricted set of models, restricted data, and ignoring the degree of support for a particular strategy, we would typically conclude that 89\% of participants used an information-integration strategy. We discuss the implications of potentially erroneous strategy identification for the security of conclusions about the categorization capabilities of various participant and patient groups. Perceptual category learning refers to the process by which we learn to organize different perceptual objects into distinct groups. The cognitive machinery underpinning this ability has been the focus of extensive research, and a large part of this effort has involved attempts to develop computational models that can ac-count for our capacity to categorize (Pothos \& Wills, 2011). Often, alternative models are fitted to classification data in an attempt to identify the categorization strategy used across different conditions of testing and by different populations of subjects, such as younger versus older adults, or patients with different neurological disor-ders. We argue here that such identification would benefit from improvements in the type of data used to fit models, the procedures for fitting and selecting among those models, and the range of models under consideration. This reevaluation of data, models and methods has significant implications for theories of category learn-ing and for the security of conclusions about the categorization capabilities of various participant groups. We illustrate and demonstrate the value of our approach by examining some of the evidence presented in support of one the most influential models of perceptual categorization: COVIS (Competition between Verbal and Implicit Systems; Ashby, Alfonso-Reese, Turken, \& Waldron, 1998). According to COVIS, categories can be acquired via a verbal system that generates and tests simple verbalizable hypotheses, or rules, and depends on structures in the anterior cingulate, the prefrontal cortices, the medial temporal lobe, and the head of the caudate nucleus (Ashby \& Ell, 2001; Ashby \& Spiering, 2004; Nomura \& Reber, 2008). In addition, categories can be learned via a procedural system that learns to associate a response with regions of perceptual space based on reinforcement (Ashby, Paul, \& Maddox, 2011) and depends on neural structures in the tail of the caudate nucleus (Ashby et al., 1998; Nomura \& Reber, 2008). Two types of category tasks are typically used to index the hypothesized differential engagement of these systems in category learning. In " rule-based " (RB) tasks, optimal performance can be achieved via the use of sets of logical rules for partitioning the objects into categories. In implementing such logical rules, the observer makes separate decisions about the values of objects along their component dimensions and then combines those deci-sions to determine which rule has been satisfied. For example, lines varying in their length and orientation might be assigned to},

Across 4 experiments, we examined the effects of 2 variables, the delay between response and feedback and the informativeness of feedback, which had previously been shown to dissociate learning of the 2 types of category structure. Our aim was twofold: first, to determine whether these dissociations meet the more stringent inferential criteria of state-trace analysis and, second, to determine the conditions under which they can be observed. Experiment 1 confirmed that a mask-filled feedback delay dissociated the learning of RB and II category structures with minimally informative (yes/no) feedback and also met the state-trace criteria for the involvement of multiple latent variables. Experiment 2 showed that this effect is eliminated when a less similar, fixed pattern mask is presented in the interval between response and feedback. Experiment 3 showed that the selective effect of feedback delay on II learning is reduced with fully informative feedback (in which the correct category is specified after an incorrect response) and that feedback type did not dissociate RB and II learning. Experiment 4 extended the results of Experiment 2, showing that the differential effect of feedback delay is eliminated when a fixed pattern mask is used. These results pose important challenges to models of category learning, and we discuss their implications for multiple learning system models and their alternatives.},

Participants learned two classification tasks in which successful learning required attention to different stimulus features, thus providing a means to index how representations of individual stimuli are reorganized according to changing task goals. We used a computational learning model to capture how people attended to goal-relevant features and organized object representations based on those features during learning. Using representational similarity analyses of functional magnetic resonance imaging data, we demonstrate that neural representations in left anterior HPC correspond with model predictions of concept organization. Moreover, we show that during early learning, when concept updating is most consequential, HPC is functionally coupled with prefrontal regions. Based on these findings, we propose that when task goals change, object representations in HPC can be organized in new ways, resulting in updated concepts that highlight the features most critical to the new goal.},

The first is the generalized context model (e.g., Nosofsky, 1986, 1992) and the second is a recently proposed deterministic exemplar model (Ashby \& Maddox, in press), which contains the generalized context model as a special case. When the exemplars from each category were normally distributed and the optimal decision bound was linear, the deterministic exemplar model and the decision bound model provided roughly equivalent accounts of the data. When the optimal decision bound was non-linear, the decision bound model provided a more accurate account of the data than did either exemplar model. When applied to categorization data collected by Nosofsky (1986, 1989), in which the category exemplars are not normally distributed, the decision bound model provided excellent accounts of the data, in many cases significantly outperforming the exemplar models. The decision bound model was found to be especially successful when (1) single subject analyses were performed, (2) each subject was given relatively extensive training, and (3) the subject's performance was characterized by complex suboptimalities. These results support the hypothesis that the decision bound is of fundamental importance in predicting asymptotic categorization performance and that the decision bound models provide a viable alternative to the currently popular exemplar models of categorization.},

Accuracy rates were examined to isolate global performance deficits, and model-based analyses were performed to identify the types of response strategies used by observers. A-B training (consistent mapping) led to more accurate responding relative to yes-no training (variable mapping) in the information-integration category learning task. Model-based analyses indicated that the yes-no accuracy decline was due to an increase in the use of rule-based strategies to solve the information-integration task. Yes-no training had no effect on the accuracy of responding or distribution of best-fitting models relative to A-B training in the rule-based category learning tasks. These results both provide support for a multiple-systems approach to category learning in which one system is procedural-learning-based and argue against the validity of single-system approaches.},

An experiment using ill-defined categories composed of photographs of women was designed to test this assumption. Experimental manipulations required subjects to learn either identification (exemplar level) and/or classification (category level) responses to the photographs . Exemplar learning was generally found to proceed faster and with fewer errors than did category learning, and depending on the specific procedural manipulation, abstraction ranged from good to poor. Interactive- and independent-cue models were applied to the transfer data. The fits of the models indicated that when abstraction was good (as defined by transfer performance), the interactive-cue model best characterized the results; as degree of abstraction declined, the independent-cue model performed best. The results were discussed in terms of the relative contributions of category-level and exemplar-specific (idiosyncratic) information during classification learning.},

In contrast, we find that a domain-general learning algorithm explains key findings in both spatial and conceptual domains. When the clustering model is applied to spatial navigation tasks, so-called place and grid cell-like representations emerge because of the relatively uniform distribution of possible inputs in these tasks. The same mechanism applied to conceptual tasks, where the overall space can be higher-dimensional and sampling sparser, leading to representations more aligned with human conceptual knowledge. Although the types of memory supported by the MTL are superficially dissimilar, the information processing steps appear shared. Our account suggests that the MTL uses a general-purpose algorithm to learn and organize context-relevant information in a useful format, rather than relying on navigation-specific neural circuitry.},

The field of category learning provides an excellent exemplar. We present a critical examination of this field focusing on empirical, methodological, and mathematical modeling considerations. We review what is often presented as the "best evidence" for multiple systems of category learning and critique the evidence by considering three questions: (1) Are multiple-systems accounts the only viable explanations for reported effects? (2) Are the inferences sound logically and methodologically? (3) Are the mathematical models that can account for behavior sufficiently constrained, and are alternative (single-system) models applicable? We conclude that the evidence for multiple-systems accounts of category learning does not withstand such scrutiny. We end by discussing the varieties of explanation that can be offered for psychological phenomena and highlight why multiple-systems accounts often provide an illusory sense of scientific progress. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

The medial temporal lobe (MTL) is thought to play a crucial role in successful RB categorization, whereas the posterior regions of the caudate are hypothesized to support II categorization. Functional neuroimaging was used to assess activity in these systems during category-learning tasks with category structures designed to afford either RB or II learning. Successful RB categorization was associated with relatively increased activity in the anterior MTL. Successful II categorization was associated with increased activity in the caudate body. The dissociation observed with neuroimaging is consistent with the roles of these systems in memory and dissociations reported in patient populations. Convergent evidence from these approaches consistently reinforces the idea of multiple neural systems supporting category learning.},

A much richer data set was collected, however, which enabled the generation of block-by-block learning curves suitable for quantitative fitting. Four current computational models of classification learning were fitted to the learning data: ALCOVE (Kruschke, 1992), the rational model (Anderson, 1991), the configural-cue model (Gluck \& Bower, 1988b), and an extended version of the configural-cue model with dimensionalized, adaptive learning rate mechanisms.

The present research provides evidence that some form of overall difficulty or category complexity lies at the root of the dissociation. The authors report studies in which procedural interference is observed for even simple rule-based structures under more sensitive testing conditions. Furthermore, the magnitude of the interference is large when the nature of the rule is made more complex. By contrast, the magnitude of interference is greatly reduced for an information integration structure that is cognitively simple.

The recognition advantage for deviant items extends to unsupervised learning situations. Exemplar-based and hypothesis-testing models cannot account for these results.

The experimental procedure conformed to the usual paired-associate paradigm except that only two responses were used. That is, the eight stimuli were presented, one at a time, in a continuing random sequence and an association between each stimulus and one of two alternative classificatory responses was built up by the method of anticipation. Six female freshmen at Fairleigh Dickinson University served for 15 hours each in this first experiment. These subjects ( S s) were selected to be as uniform as possible with respect to their college entrance examination scores. A combined empirical and theoretical investigation of the difficulties of different kinds of classifications was undertaken using both learning and memory tasks. Sets of stimuli of a variety of kinds were used but, in each set, there were eight stimuli each of which took on one of two possible values on each of three different dimensions. Results showed that of the 70 possible classifications of the eight stimuli into two equal groups, there are only six basic types. The different classifications belonging to any one of these types have the same structure; they differ only with respect to which of the three dimensions is assigned to which of the three roles in the classification, and with respect to which of the two classificatory responses is assigned to which group of four stimuli.},

We contribute a new dissociative paradigm, adapting the technique of deferred-rearranged reinforcement from comparative psychology. Participants learned matched category tasks that had either a one-dimensional, rule-based solution or a multidimensional, information-integration solution. They received feedback either immediately or after each block of trials, with the feedback organized such that positive outcomes were grouped and negative outcomes were grouped (deferred-rearranged reinforcement). Deferred reinforcement qualitatively eliminated implicit, information-integration category learning. It left intact explicit, rule-based category learning. Moreover, implicit-category learners facing deferred-rearranged reinforcement turned by default and information-processing necessity to rule-based strategies that poorly suited their nominal category task. The results represent one of the strongest explicit-implicit dissociations yet seen in the categorization literature.},

We apply this approach in several comparative domains to show that different task variants change\textemdash in concert\textemdash the level of awareness, the declarative nature of knowledge, the dimen- sional breadth of knowledge, and the brain systems that orga- nize learning.

These changes define the limit of associative learning and the threshold of explicit cognition. The neural-systems framework can broaden empir- ical horizons in comparative psychology.

Here we demonstrate that AIC values can be easily transformed to so-called Akaike weights (e.g., Akaike, 1978, 1979; Bozdogan, 1987; Burnham \& Anderson, 2002), which can be directly interpreted as conditional probabilities for each model.

  abstract = {This article describes a neuropsychological theory of motor skill learning that is based on the idea that learning grows directly out of motor control processes. Three motor control processes may be tuned to specific tasks, thereby improving performance: selecting spatial targets for movement, sequencing these targets, and transforming them into muscle commands. These processes operate outside of awareness. A 4th, conscious process can improve performance in either of 2 ways: by selecting more effective goals of what should be changed in the environment or by selecting and sequencing spatial targets. The theory accounts for patterns of impairment of motor skill learning in patient populations and for learning-related changes in activity in functional imaging studies. It also makes a number of predictions about the purely cognitive, including accounts of mental practice, the representation of motor skill, and the interaction of conscious and unconscious processes in motor skill learning.},

  abstract = {Previous work (Willingham, 1999) has indicated that implicit motor sequence learning is not pri- marily perceptual; that is, what is learned is not a sequence of stimuli. Still other work has indicated that implicit motor sequence learning is not specific to particular muscle groups or effectors. In the pre- sent work, we tested whether implicit motor sequence learning would be represented as a sequence of response locations. In Experiment 1,learning showed very poor transfer when the response locations were changed, even though the stimulus positions were unchanged. In Experiment 2, participants switched their hand positions at transfer, so that one group of participants pushed the same sequence of keys but used a different sequence of finger movements to do so, whereas another group pushed a different sequence of keys but used the same sequence of finger movements used at training. Knowl- edge ofthe sequence was shown at transfer only ifthe sequence of response locations was maintained, not the sequence of finger movements.},

  abstract = {Categorization is one of the fundamental building blocks of cognition, and the study of categorization is notable for the extent to which formal modeling has been a central and influential component of research. However, the field has seen a proliferation of divergent, non-complementary models with little consensus on the relative adequacy of these accounts. Progress on assessing relative adequacy of formal categorization models against these criteria has, to date, been limited because (a) formal model comparisons are narrow in the number of models and phenomena considered, and (b) models do not often clearly define their explanatory scope. Progress is further hampered by the practice of fitting models with arbitrarily variable parameters to each data set independently. Reviewing examples of good practice in the literature, we conclude that model comparisons are most fruitful when relative adequacy is assessed by comparing well-defined models on the basis of the number and proportion of irreversible, ordinal, penetrable successes (principles of minimal flexibility, breadth, good-enough precision, maximal simplicity, and psychological focus).},

  pages = {1--33},
  abstract = {Does cognition begin with an undifferentiated stimulus whole, which can be divided into distinct attributes if time and cognitive resources allow (Differentiation Theory)? Or does it begin with the attributes, which are combined if time and cognitive resources allow (Combination Theory)? Across psychology, use of the terms analytic and non-analytic imply that Differentiation Theory is correct-if cognition begins with the attributes, then synthesis, rather than analysis, is the more appropriate chemical analogy. We re-examined four classic studies of the effects of time pressure, incidental training, and concurrent load on classification and category learning (Kemler Nelson, 1984; Smith \& Kemler Nelson, 1984; Smith \& Shapiro, 1989; Ward, 1983). These studies are typically interpreted as supporting Differentiation Theory over Combination Theory, while more recent work in classification (Milton et al., 2008, et seq.) supports the opposite conclusion. Across seven experiments, replication and re-analysis of the four classic studies revealed that they do not support Differentiation Theory over Combination Theory-two experiments support Combination Theory over Differentiation Theory, and the remainder are compatible with both accounts. We conclude that Combination Theory provides a parsimonious account of both classic and more recent work in this area. The presented data do not require Differentiation Theory, nor a Combination-Differentiation hybrid account.},

  year = {2019},
  abstract = {Smith and Church (2018) present a ``testimonial'' review of dissociable learning processes in comparative and cognitive psychology, by which we mean they include only the portion of the available evidence that is consistent with their conclusions. For example, they conclude that learning the information-integration category-learning task with immediate feedback is implicit, but do not consider the evidence that people readily report explicit strategies in this task, nor that this task can be accommodated by accounts that make no distinction between implicit and explicit processes. They also consider some of the neuroscience relating to information-integration category learning, but do not report those aspects that are more consistent with an explicit than an implicit account. They further conclude that delay conditioning in humans is implicit, but do not report evidence that delay conditioning requires awareness; nor do they present the evidence that con- ditioned taste aversion, which should be explicit under their account, can be implicit. We agree with Smith and Church that it is helpful to have a clear definition of associative theory, but suggest that their definition may be unnecessarily restrictive. We propose an alternative definition of associative theory and briefly describe an experimental procedure that we think may better distinguish between associative and non-associative processes.},
